# Productivity Tools Web
- Productivity Tools is a project that contains various tools for enhancing productivity
- I created these tools because I was unable to find similar tools online
- This repository contains the frontend web app for Productivity Tools
	- It uses ReactJS, Redux and React Router
- You can view it live [here](https://rtkleong10.github.io/productivity-tools-web/)
    - The web app is served using GitHub Pages
- It consumes API endpoints from the [backend server](https://github.com/rtkleong10/productivity-tools/)
- This project uses Django Rest Framework and has a browsable API
